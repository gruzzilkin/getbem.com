# Get BEM!

We are gathering information about BEM methodology in separation with building tools. It is clear, that you will need some building stage after you split CSS into files, so Building article is also there. Building article will be separated from concrete building tool by providing multiple tools for building BEM project.

If you interested in writing articles or helping with site â€” feel free to make pull-requests or [creating issues](https://github.com/floatdrop/getbem.com/issues) with discussions.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/floatdrop/getbem.com
